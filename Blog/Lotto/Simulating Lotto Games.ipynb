    "So here are the questions that I would like to address. How do you estimate the number of ticket buyers from the number of winners at each division?\n",
    "\n",
    "Intuitively, the number of winners will depend on the number of tickets sold, and the popularity of certain numbers. e.g. if the draw result features a popular sequence of numbers, then you 'should' expect more winners at the lower divisions. At the same time, if more people show up on the day to buy tickets, then you also would expect more people to win then as well.\n",
    "\n",
    "At the higher divisions (esp. the jackpot + powerball), you would expect the dominating factor to be the a-priori odds of winning.\n",

My guess is that the more popular the winning numbers are, the number of winners will be skewed towards the lower division winners, and if the winning numbers are unpopular, then the number of winners will more closely match the theoretical distribution."
