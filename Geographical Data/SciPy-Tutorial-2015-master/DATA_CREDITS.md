The file `landsat.tif` was derived from Landsat 8 data downloaded through [Libra](https://libra.developmentseed.org) and served by [AWS](http://aws.amazon.com/public-data-sets/landsat). The original file is [LC80420272015130LGN00](http://landsat-pds.s3.amazonaws.com/L8/042/027/LC80420272015130LGN00/index.html) from 10 May 2015 and was processed with [landsat-util](https://github.com/developmentseed/landsat-util) to reduce the number of bands. The Landsat 8 files are in the public domain, and I hereby release my changes in the file `landsat.tif` to the public domain under [CC0](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0).

The file `manhattan.tif` is a [Digital Orthophoto Quadrangle (DOQ)](https://lta.cr.usgs.gov/DOQs) from the USGS and in the public domain ([direct link](http://earthexplorer.usgs.gov/metadata/1131/DI00000000845784)).
